## 0. Introduction
As the industry matures, developers' concerns are poised to move towards dealing with operations of server infrastructure rather than development itself. The reason stands out a mile, it's simply more painful to deal with unexpected events. There are lots of resources out there to help you build a software with such as frameworks, libraries, templates, best practices of all sorts, and so on. Not to mention, IDEs on steroid are getting better all the time which provides you with automated tools. It just takes a single fool to build a great software these days. (Forgive me!) 

However, something people underestimated at the first sight turned out to be the most stressful experience; _Set the servers up and running_. (and maintain it!) Something you thought the last simple step for your development project turned out to be the separate portion of substantial workloads that needs to be taken care of from the beginning of the project. Now, that's where _DevOps_ comes in.
